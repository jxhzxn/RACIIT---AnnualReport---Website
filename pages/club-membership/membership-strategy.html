            <!-- <span class="question">How is your club perceived and recognized currently in public?</span> -->
            <br/><br/>
            For any movement to function effectively, it’s essential to build a strong foundation, which is its member base. When it comes to the Rotaract Club of IIT, our members play a very important role as they are the backbone of our club. In addition to helping them find their place within and outside the club, we also take it as our responsibility to keep the member base retained and active.

            <br/><br/>

            Yearly we have members going out, the majority being fourth years who leave the institute after graduation. However, those gaps are always filled, and surprisingly showing an increment each year with the help of our September and January intakes.
            <br/><br/>
            We believe in fostering a good understanding about RACIIT from the very early stages of being a member. This year, we initiated  ‘Introduction to RACIIT’ and ‘Intro to newbies’ simply just to attract new members to the club. Owing to the strict movement restrictions imposed by the government, we had to conduct this project on a virtual platform but it was immensely impactful as we were able to draw 90+ new members. The session was conducted via zoom and the board carried out a quick but thoroughly engaging session to give them a better understanding as to what the RACIIT is all about, our vision, and their role as members. The session was concluded with a fun time of trivia inclusive of prizes for the top three winners, just to assess how much they have grasped from the session.
            <br/><br/>
            Along with every new intake, comes in a batch of new members to the club. The very first time we get to make an impression is during a 20–30-minute session in a full-house orientation program organized by the institute. Given the very limited time, we always make the best of it by giving a quick briefing about the club, presenting a few of RACIIT’s signature project after movies (sally’s manor, Hot Dog Showdown etc.) and simultaneously a piece of paper would be passed around to collect the names and contact details of individuals who are interested in joining the club . Although the September intake was approached physically, the January intake was approached on a virtual platform where a WhatsApp group invite was spammed on the chat for anyone who were interested in joining the club. With passing time, according to project attendance and contribution towards club activities we filtered and made a separate group, comprising both intakes for just the active members and those interested.
            <br/><br/>
            With the situation of the country settling down following the first wave, we hosted a few physical general meetings just for these members who were already actively engaged in projects to get to know their fellow members from the other batches. These general meetings had the same structure of directors giving updates and allowing the respective committees to put in their thoughts. We always encourage the committees of projects (General members) to give updates at general meetings to help them develop their soft skills. Nevertheless, owing to the unpredictability of the COVID situation we also made sure that the meetings consisted of highly interactive sessions including icebreakers and team building games to make the best of the opportunities given.
            <br/><br/>
            Elaborating more on General meetings, these customary meetings have been carried out every year where the first meeting of every intake would be interactive, and members must be highly engaged. Starting off with the introductory session, where one would be required to tell her name, age, school, degree, and to add a little spice to it he or she had to share her relationship status which always leaves everyone highly enthusiastic, displaying the fun side of RACIIT. The very first general meeting of every new intake never goes by without it being a fun time of fellowship, making it a comfortable place for anyone to fit in.
            <br/><br/>
            Adding to these we also keep our members active by sending them for events hosted by other clubs of the Rotaract District 3220. We send them based on the field they are mainly interested in. We do have a widespread member base which consists of those who love sports, quizzes, drama, hackathons, singing, webinars and so on. Therefore, we categorize them accordingly and send them for events based on their area of expertise and personal interests. By this they will not only be able to bring out their inner talents, but they will also get a deeper understanding on what Rotaract is about and  get to know and build long lasting friendships with  fellow rotaractors from  the  clubs of RID 3220. 
            <br/><br/>
            Apart from other club events, the advantage of maintaining healthy friendships with our members enables us to select committees based on their skills and interests. Moreover, we also have an editorial team for those who like working behind the scenes and have a passion for writing. Giving them this opportunity has not only benefited the club but also helped them discover their abilities and even gain training for a future career in the corporate world. Our club also offers an opportunity for those of who may be interested in videography, photography, content creating, etc. and additionally also provides the opportunity to learn new things concerning these areas, providing they are involved in the media circle of RACIIT.
            <br/><br/>
            We also re-initiated RACIITians of the month this year to appreciate the members who work hard towards the development of the club. This we believed would motivate others too to be more active and we were able to get almost all of our members engaged in projects and events. Once this pandemic settles, we will be having an awarding ceremony where we will be giving recognition to the members who became RACIITians of the month.

            <br/><br/>
            The year started off with the project Truth or Dare which was only open to RACIITians for the sole purpose of getting to know them better and for them to make new friendships within the club. Owing to the very successful project outcome, we extended it further to Truth or Dare 2.0 which made a bigger impact. Truth or dare 2.0 had one uniqueness which made the project stand out this year. Generally, the members who are from the infoschol batches do not actively engage in projects owing to their busy schedules of having to balance both studies and work. However, this year with projects moving on to virtual platforms gave the opportunity for info-school students to actively engage in projects as well. In fact, almost half of the committee consisted of our infoschol members, and they were very grateful to have had the opportunity of making new friends within and outside the club. 

            <br/><br/>
            This year we also bought in a new initiative titled project “Challenge Dot Connect” to get the new intake members to engage with our other members and have a time of fellowship with each other in addition to getting a deeper understanding on the culture of RACIIT.  We had a total of 213 members from all batches who were engaged in a set of team building events and ice breakers. This event went on for 3 full days and the fourth day being the award ceremony. This project brought more closure to the members who did not have the ability to get to know those in the club from the other batches which was the end goal initially when we planned this project out.

            <br/><br/>

            Having reached the end of the Rotaract year, we have managed to maintain the essence of our club like we do every year by overcoming the barrier of the pandemic situation and successfully achieving our goal of membership development and retention.
